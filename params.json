Install [AWS Unified CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli)\r\n2. Make sure you have `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` set in your environment\r\n3. Put all your PEM files under `~/.aws`\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:uriagassi/sash.git\r\n    cd sash\r\n    make install\r\n    echo \"source ~/.local/bin/sash.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\r\n    source ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**SSH Connect**\r\n\r\n    sash my-machine-name\r\n    \r\nAlso supports auto-complete (press `TAB` to get available machine names)\r\n\r\nTo refresh the machine name cache for the autocomplete run\r\n\r\n    clear_sash\r\n    \r\n**Find machine name from private IP**\r\n\r\n[Newrelic](http://www.newrelic.com)'s server monitoring names the instances it monitors by their private IPs by default (`ip-10-0-0-12`), which is practically useless. \r\nThis API finds the instance which has this private IP, and returns the instance's name tag:\r\n\r\n    private_dns_to_name ip-10-XXX-XXX-XXX\r\n    \r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
